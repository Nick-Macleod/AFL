/* 
I have a table game_stats with all the individual stats for players throughout the 2016 season
game-by-game. From this I'm creating a table to make the fixture in an easily used form for SQL.
I'm also using this as a learning opportunity for my SQL skills.

This first query creates an ordered list that the fixture can be gleaned from.

CREATE TABLE fixture2016 AS 
SELECT DISTINCT Team, round from game_stats
WHERE Season=2016

/*
Used the row numbers (as they were ordered by the fixture) to pair off
teams that are playing against each other for that week
*/

CREATE TABLE fixtures2016 AS
SELECT Team, round,
   FLOOR((ROW_NUMBER() OVER (
	ORDER BY round
   )+1)/2) pairfixtures2016

Test it to make sure it worked

/* 
Of course its simple to use these code snippets to make a fixture for other seasons too!
Use this website: https://afltables.com/afl/seas/season_idx.html
to check if your tables worked (mine did!).
