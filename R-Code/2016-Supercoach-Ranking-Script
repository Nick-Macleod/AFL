# I wanted to add a ranking of each player in every game using supercoach, as I suspect
# that unless they are one of the top players as assesed by SC they won't get any votes.
# There are two data files I used here: the SC scores I obtained off the web and 
# a fixtures dataset I made in SQL from the complete stats I obtained off Ben 
# see my SQL code in this repository for how I did this.
